Electric Avenue: Server + Database
===============
Electric Avenue is a single-platform solution for connecting people to street vendors. Examples of these types of vendors includes artists, musicians, performers, food vendors/food trucks, pop-up sellers of goods and farmers market purveyors.
Users are able to view vendors on a map or in a list and filter their search by various criteria, including vendor types, location, rating, etc. Users can also seamlessly tip/pay vendors, rate vendors and receive recommendations based on their prior ratings.

Vendors manage an in-app home page viewable by users that contains information about the vendor’s services or goods. Vendors appear to users on the map or list view when they “check-in” to begin vending. Vendors will also receive recommendations about the best areas for them to operate based on pedestrian volume statistics, tipping history, Square analytics and other data collected from the application.
